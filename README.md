## PDF (JODConverter) Rest API

This is a sample application of a rest api that uses the spring boot integration module of the Java OpenDocument Converter (JODConverter) project to offer document conversion capabilities. The goal was to emulate a LibreOffice Online server that
would support the customization of custom (known) load/store properties.
